                <p>Basketball invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Naismith">James Naismith</a></p>
                <p>Basketball invented in 1891 . </p>
                <p>The history :James Naismith (NAY-smith; November 6, 1861 – November 28, 1939) was a
                    Canadian-American[1] physical educator, physician, Christian chaplain, and sports coach, best known
                    as the inventor of the game of basketball.[2][3] After moving to the United States, he wrote the
                    original basketball rule book and founded the University of Kansas basketball program.[4] Naismith
                    lived to see basketball adopted as an Olympic demonstration sport in 1904 and as an official event
                    at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, as well as the birth of the National Invitation Tournament
                    (1938) and the NCAA Tournament (1939).

                    Naismith studied and taught physical education at McGill University in Montreal until 1890 before
                    moving to Springfield, Massachusetts, United States later that year, where in 1891 he designed the
                    game of basketball while he was teaching at the International YMCA Training School.[5] Seven years
                    after inventing basketball, Naismith received his medical degree in Denver in 1898. He then arrived
                    at the University of Kansas, later becoming the Kansas Jayhawks' athletic director and coach.[5]
                    While a coach at Kansas, Naismith coached Phog Allen, who later became the coach at Kansas for 39
                    seasons, beginning a lengthy and prestigious coaching tree. Allen then went on to coach legends
                    including Adolph Rupp and Dean Smith, among others, who themselves coached many notable players and
                    future coaches.[6]

                        <p>Invention of the game
                            The game of basketball as it is known today was created by Dr. James Naismith in December
                            1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts, to condition young athletes during cold months. Naismith
                            was a physical education instructor at YMCA International Training School (now known as
                            Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts. Upon the request of his boss, Naismith
                            was tasked to create an indoor sports game to help athletes keep in shape in cold
                            weather.[1] It consisted of peach baskets and a soccer style ball. He published 13 rules for
                            the new game. He divided his class of eighteen into two teams of nine players each and set
                            about to teach them the basics of his new game. The objective of the game was to throw the
                            basketball into the fruit baskets nailed to the lower railing of the gym balcony. Every time
                            a point was scored, the game was halted so the janitor could bring out a ladder and retrieve
                            the ball. After a while, the bottoms of the fruit baskets were removed. The first public
                            basketball game was played in Springfield, Massachusetts, on March 11, 1892.[2]

                        <h2>Basketball Rules</h2>
                        <p>
                        <h1><b>Rules for the offense</b></h1>br

                        The basketball team on offense is the team with the basketball. When a player has the
                        basketball there are certain rules they must follow:

                        1) The player must bounce, or dribble, the ball with one hand while moving both feet. If, at
                        any time, both hands touch the ball or the player stops dribbling, the player must only move
                        one foot. The foot that is stationary is called the pivot foot.

                        2) The basketball player can only take one turn at dribbling. In other words, once a player
                        has stopped dribbling they cannot start another dribble. A player who starts dribbling again
                        is called for a double-dribbling violation and looses the basketball to the other team. A
                        player can only start another dribble after another player from either team touches or gains
                        control of the basketball. This is usually after a shot or pass.

                        3) The ball must stay in bounds. If the offensive team looses the ball out of bounds the
                        other team gets control of the basketball.

                        4) The players hand must be on top of the ball while dribbling. If they touch the bottom of
                        the basketball while dribbling and continue to dribble this is called carrying the ball and
                        the player will lose the ball to the other team.

                        5) Once the offensive team crosses half court, they may not go back into the backcourt. This
                        is called a backcourt violation. If the defensive team knocks the ball into the backcourt,
                        then the offensive team can recover the ball legally.

                        <p>Defensive Rules

                            The team on defense is the team without the basketball.

                            1) The main rule for the defensive player is not to foul. A foul is described as gaining an
                            unfair advantage through physical contact. There is some interpretation that has to be made
                            by the referee, but, in general, the defensive player may not touch the offensive player in
                            a way that causes the offensive player to lose the ball or miss a shot.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Rules for everyone

                        </h1>
                        <p>1) Although the foul rule is described above as a defensive rule, it applies exactly the
                            same to all players on the court including offensive players.

                            2) Basketball players cannot kick the ball or hit it with their fist.

                            3) No player can touch the basketball while it is traveling downward towards the basket or
                            if it is on the rim. This is called goaltending. (touching the ball on the rim is legal in
                            some games).

                            Every player on the court is subject to the same rules regardless of the position they play.
                            The positions in basketball are just for team basketball strategy and there are no positions
                            in the rules.
                        </p>
